/**
Suppose we have a knapsack which can hold int w = 10 weight units. We have a total of int n = 4 items to choose from, 
whose values are represented by an array int[] val = {10, 40, 30, 50} and weights represented by an array int[] wt = {5, 4, 6, 3}.
Since this is the 0â€“1 knapsack problem, we can either include an item in our knapsack or exclude it,
 but not include a fraction of it, or include it multiple times.
 
 n items
 w limit =10

 table of n+1 rows
 w+1 columns
 
 Total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and total value is as large as possible
